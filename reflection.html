									<h2>ASSIGNMENT 4: NEWSLETTER</h2>
									<h3>TECH-DRIVEN INNOVATION: UNLEASHING THE POWER OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR BUSINESS GROWTH IN URBAN FARMING-SOLUTION (I-FARM)</h3>
									<p>This talk has opened my eyes to how important technology is to humans today.The I-Farm model presented a creative solution for delivering fresh organic produce to communities. I-Farm utilizes IoT into agriculture to supervise and manage farming procedures. IoT also helps in order to supply chain transparency, enabling consumers to trace the origins of their vegetables and farmers to track their shipments. Besides, I-Farm utilizes cloud computing for efficient storage and retrieval of extensive data. Due to COVID-19 Pandemic, I-Farm has shifted to online markets which facilitates user access to a broader range of produce, potentially sourced directly from farms, thereby decreasing environmental impact through optimized resource utilization and reduced waste. To sum up, these technologies should be appreciated as they have facilitated human affairs and simplified our daily tasks.</p>

									<h2>PC ASSEMBLE</h2>
									<p>I gained knowledge about the inside components of the PC—which I had never seen before—during the PC assembly session. We were split up into groups of four or five people each to share a single CPU. The CPU was distributed before we reassembled it. The motherboard is then inserted into the CPU frame. We ensure that both components were correctly positioned before locking up. The power supply cable was connected as well to the motherboard. After that, the RAM board was put into the frame.  Finally, the VGA card, wire card, and all other cables were connected before the cover case was placed. I also learnt the functions of each components in the CPU and how it works in the system. Thanks to Dr Azurah and all the technicians for giving me this learning experience.</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>DESIGN THINKING</h2>
									<p>According to what I discovered while working on this project, design thinking has a big influence on my ability to solve problems in an organised and creative way. As design thinking promotes a holistic view of problems, considering both technical and human factors, I was influenced to create more applications and technologies which help to produce more comprehensive and effective solutions for all.</p>
